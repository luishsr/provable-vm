## Provable VM - An Open Source Virtual Machine with ZK-Proof Integration

# Overview
Provable VM is an open-source Rust-based virtual machine designed to run a set of instructions while providing cryptographic zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) capabilities. This project leverages advanced ZK-proof libraries like ark-groth16 and Bls12-381 to ensure the integrity and privacy of computational execution. The VM integrates a constraint system that enforces state correctness, making it ideal for secure and verifiable computational tasks.

# Key Features:
- Fully functional virtual machine (VM) with a stack-based instruction set.
- Integrated zero-knowledge proof system using arkworks.
- Ability to verify program execution using Groth16 proofs.
- Cryptographic trace commitment for program execution.
- Modularized codebase for ease of understanding and contribution.
- Comprehensive error handling for robust performance.

# Getting Started:
Prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Basic understanding of Rust programming.
- Familiarity with zero-knowledge proofs is helpful but not required.

# Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/luishsr/provable-vm.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd provable-vm`
3. Build the project:
   `cargo build`
4. Run tests:

Usage:
To run a program using Provable VM:
1. Create a program file (e.g., `program.prov`) with instructions:

2. Execute the program:
   `cargo run -- program.prov`
3. Generate proofs:
   Use the integrated proof-generation features to create and verify proofs for program execution.
